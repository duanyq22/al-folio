Welcome to my site! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University](https://orfe.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests lie in machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning. I work on statistical analysis of batch reinforcement learning and dimensionality reduction methods for large stochastic systems. Prior to Princeton, I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University, China.
